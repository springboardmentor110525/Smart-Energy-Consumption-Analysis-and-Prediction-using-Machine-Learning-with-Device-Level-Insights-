# Smart Energy Consumption Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the development of **Smart Energy Consumption Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning with Device-Level Insights**. The project is being built in milestones, with each week focusing on specific tasks, starting with dataset preprocessing.

### Dataset used: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drmtya/smart-home-energy-consumption-optimization

## Milestone 1 – Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and inspected the dataset.
- Checked for missing values and duplicates.
- Converted `timestamp` to datetime and extracted features like `year`, `month`, and `time`.
- Performed basic checks to ensure data consistency.
- Perdormed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
