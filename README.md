# Smart Energy Consumption Analysis & Forecasting

This repository contains the complete implementation of the **Smart Energy Consumption Analysis and Prediction System**, covering the full pipeline from exploratory data analysis to model development and final web-based deployment.

The project is organized into two primary components:

---
