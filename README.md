**Smart Energy Consumption Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning with Device-Level Insights**

**Project Overview**

The Smart Energy Consumption Analysis and Prediction System is an AI-powered web application designed to analyze household energy usage at a device level, visualize consumption trends, and predict future energy consumption using machine learning models.

Traditional electricity billing systems provide only monthly usage data, which lacks actionable insights. This project addresses that gap by offering time-series analysis, intelligent forecasting, and energy-saving recommendations through an interactive dashboard.

**Objectives**

Analyze device-wise energy consumption patterns

Visualize energy usage at hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly levels

Predict future energy consumption using LSTM deep learning

Compare Linear Regression (baseline) with LSTM performance

Provide smart energy-saving suggestions

Build a scalable, web-based energy monitoring system

**Machine Learning Models**

Linear Regression – Baseline energy prediction model

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) – Advanced time-series forecasting model
