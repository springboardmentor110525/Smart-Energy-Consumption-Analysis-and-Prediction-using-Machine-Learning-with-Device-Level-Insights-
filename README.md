## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Missing value handling (forward/backward fill)  
   - Outlier removal using **IQR method**  
   - Normalization with MinMaxScaler  
   - Resampling to hourly/daily aggregates  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Time‑based features: hour, day, month, day_of_week  
   - Lag features: previous hour/day/week consumption  
   - Rolling statistics: moving averages (3h, 24h, 168h)  
   - Device‑level aggregations  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Baseline: Linear Regression  
   - Advanced: LSTM neural networks with hyperparameter tuning  
   - Cross‑validation for robustness  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²  
   - Comparison table saved for reproducibility  
   - Visualization of actual vs predicted consumption  

5. **Visualization & Dashboard**  
   - Hourly/Daily/Weekly/Monthly consumption plots  
   - Device‑level pie chart of usage distribution  
   - Smart tips generated based on consumption patterns  

6. **Deployment**  
   - Flask backend serving predictions and dashboards  
   - Embedded frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) for user interaction  
   - REST API for real‑time energy monitoring
